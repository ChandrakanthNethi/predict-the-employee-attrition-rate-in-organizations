# Predict the employee attrition rate in organizations
## Using PyCaret
The notebook created as part of this repository contains the solution for the hackathon organized by [Hacker Earth](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge-predict-employee-attrition-rate/). This solution is implemented in just under 5 minutes using [PyCaret](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret).

## Setup Instructions
The following is a brief set of instructions on setting up a virtual environment with PyCaret:
- Create a virtual environment with Python version as 3.6.
- Activate the virtual environment.
- Execute command `pip install pycaret` to install PyCaret.
- Run the [notebook](https://github.com/ChandrakanthNethi/predict-the-employee-attrition-rate-in-organizations/blob/master/notebooks/train_and_predict.ipynb) to generate predictions.

With this simple setup and PyCaret, I ended up in the top 4% in the hackathon.
