# Predict the employee attrition rate in organizations
## Using PyCaret


## Setup Instructions
The following is a brief set of instructions on setting up a virtual environment with PyCaret
- Create a virtual environment with Python version as 3.6.
- Activate the virtual environment.
- Excecute command `pip install pycaret` to install PyCaret.
- Run the [notebook](https://github.com/ChandrakanthNethi/predict-the-employee-attrition-rate-in-organizations/blob/master/notebooks/train_and_predict.ipynb) to generate predictions.

With this simple setup and PyCaret I ended up in top 4% in the hackathon.
